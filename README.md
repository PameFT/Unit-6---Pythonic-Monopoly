### In this homework activity, I was tasked to building a prototype dashboard. The goal of this dashboard was to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers to explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in San Francisco.

## 1 - Rental Analysis:

In this part, I worked out all of the calculations and visualizations in the analysis notebook.

## 2 - Dashboard:

After, I have worked out all of the codes and analysis from part 1, I used the Panel library to build an interactive dashboard for all of the visualizations.  

Additionally, I used the relevant object .servable() to launch this app,  as a server outside of the notebook as link below.

http://localhost:5006/dashboard
